# Spring Integration

Spring Integration provides an extension of the Spring programming model to support the well known Enterprise Integration Patterns. It enables lightweight messaging within Spring-based applications and supports integration with external systems through declarative adapters. Those adapters provide a higher level of abstraction over Spring’s support for remoting, messaging, and scheduling.

Spring Integration’s primary goal is to provide a simple model for building enterprise integration solutions while maintaining the separation of concerns that is essential for producing maintainable, testable code.

## Goals and Principles

Spring Integration is motivated by the following goals:

- Provide a simple model for implementing complex enterprise integration solutions.

- Facilitate asynchronous, message-driven behavior within a Spring-based application.

- Promote intuitive, incremental adoption for existing Spring users.

Spring Integration is guided by the following principles:

- Components should be loosely coupled for modularity and testability.

- The framework should enforce separation of concerns between business logic and integration logic.

- Extension points should be abstract in nature (but within well-defined boundaries) to promote reuse and portability.
